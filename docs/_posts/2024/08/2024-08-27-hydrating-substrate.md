### Field Capacity Recipe
You want to hydrate your substrate to field capacity to ensure it is properly hydrated for your mushrooms

**Forumla**: Weight of dry brick (g) X 5 = xml water

> Ex 650g X 5 = 3250ml water or 3.434237 quarts

### Instructions
If you would prefer a video walkthrough, there is a great one from PhillyGoldenTeacher [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzMRjEDMdfs).
1. Weigh your dry coco coir to calculate field capacity given the recipe above
2. Boil the resulting water
3. Pour boiling water into dry coco coir inside a 5-gallon bucket
4. Seal the bucket & wait for it to cool for 5-6 hours
