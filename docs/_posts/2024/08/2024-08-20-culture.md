You will need to select a culture to cultivate.

If you are looking to cultivate *magic* mushrooms, aka Psilocybin-containing mushrooms you should start out with Psilocybe cubensis.
Psilocybe cubensis is the most commonly cultivated species of psychedelic mushrooms.

Other species in the Psilocybe family produce psilocybin, but they can be more complicated to grow.  That's why for beginners a Psilocybe cubensis variety is suggested.

## Choosing a Psilocybe Cubensis variety

If you have looked before you may be confused by the many varieties of Psilocybe Cubensis that are commonly sold.

> Golden Teacher, B+, Amazonian, Hillbilly, PESA, etc.

There are tons to choose from and generally, you can not go wrong.  Some may be a little more picky to grow than others, so we would recommend a common variety like B+ to start with.

## Spores, Agar, Liquid Culture OH MY

Cultures come in many forms.  There are 2 categories: Live Cultures, and Spores.  Both have pros & cons.  However, for starting we recommend you find a LIVE culture to start with.
Nowadays you can obtain Liquid Culture for sale online.  We recommend starting with a liquid culture of a common beginner strain like B+ for the highest rates of success and the lowest risk of contamination.

| Common Forms | Liquid Culture or Agar | Spore Syringe, Swab, Print |
| Benefits & Cons | Low Risk of Contam, Fast Growth | Higher Risk of Contam, Slow Growth |
