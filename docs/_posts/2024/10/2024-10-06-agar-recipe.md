## Formula üß´

| **Ratio ‚≠êÔ∏è**             | **For 500 ml Media Bottle üß™**   |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 3g potato flakes         | 12g potato flakes                |
| 2g agar agar powder      | 8g agar agar powder              |
| 1g corn syrup            | 4g corn syrup                    |
| 1/2 cup water            | 2 cups water (about 400 ml)      |

## Directions
Measure out the following incredients in a container on a scale.  Order does not matter but I recomend:
1. Potato flakes
2. Agar agar powder
3. Corn syrup

Then, add water to a pot and add all of the ingredients.  Now mix the ingredients thoroughly, and put the heat on high to bring to a boil.

As soon as the water is boiling, transfer to your media jar and add 3-5 drops of food coloring.  Screw on the cap to the bottle leaving a little space so it is not 100% sealed to prevent pressure from building in the bottle and cracking it.

Pressure cook for 30 minutes at 15 PSI.

## How to pour agar
Agar has to be poured before it cools down enough to become a solid.  It is reccomended to pour between 140-160 degrees F. If you pour too hot you can melt your petri dishes or condiment cups.

Ideally, you should pour agar in front of a laminar flow hood.  Another option is to use a still air box.  However, for newbies I have had a lot of success in a clean kitchen, with the air off using the oven technique.

## Oven Tek
1. Turn off air/heat in your kitchen to minimize air movement
2. Clean your working area well
3. Preheat your oven to 250 degrees F
4. Set a baking rack to hang over the opening of the oven
5. Crack oven open so the air rises above the baking rack
6. Pour agar into cups/petri dishes in the airflow space
