After you have harvested your first flush, you can rehydrate your substrate to pull multiple flushes.  Sometimes you can get lucky and get over 6 flushes from your tubs.  You will notice subsequent flushes have fewer fruits, but they will be larger than the first flushes.  You can follow a video guide [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DadBbL8QuBM).

### Step 1: Filling your tub with water
You will want to fill your tub with water, and then use something on top of it to hold the substrate under water to allow it to soak up the water.  You can use another tub with a weight inside to hold the susbtrate underwater.  If you have a liner attached, you may want to pull it back slightly to allow the water to penetrate better.

### Step 2: Soaking
Allow your submerged substrate to soak for at least 6 hours and no more than 24 hours total.  I recommend allowing your tub to soak overnight.

### Step 3: Draining
Once your tub has soaked, you then need to carefully drain the water out of the tub.  Once all water has been drained, you can reintroduce fruiting conditions and wait for the new pins to form.

### How to know when I am at my max flushes?
You will know your tub has reached its limits when you no longer get fruits to form, or you spot contamination.  As soon as you see contamination, you should throw away your substrate outside to avoid spreading it to other tubs in your grow area.
