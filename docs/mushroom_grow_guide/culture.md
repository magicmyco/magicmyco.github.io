You will need to select a culture to cultivate.

If you are looking to cultivate *magic* mushrooms, aka Psilocybin containing mushrooms you should start out with Psilocybe Cubensis.
Psilocybe cubensis is the most commonly cultivated species of psychedllic mushrooms.

There are other species in the Psilocybe family that produce cubesnis, but they can be more complicated to grow.  Thats why for beginneres a Psilocoby cubesnis variety is suggested.


## Choosing a Psilocybe Cubensis variety

If you have looked before you may be confused by the many varieties of Psilocybe Cubensis that are commonly sold.
> Golden Teacher, B+, Amazonian, Hillbilly, PESA, etc.

There are tons to choose from and generally you can not go wrong.  Some may be a little more picky to grow than others, so we would reccomend a common variety likee B+ to start with.

## Spores, Agar, Liquid Culture OH MY

Cultures come in many forms.  There are 2 categories: Live Cultures, and Spores.  Both have pros & cons.  However, for starting out we reccomend you find a LIVE culture to start with.
