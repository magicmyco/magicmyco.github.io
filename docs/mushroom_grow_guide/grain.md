To cultivate mushrooms, you need to select a grain to innoculate.  For a beginner, you have 2 main paths to go down.

1. Premade grain (Uncle Bens Tek / Prepped Grain Bags)
2. Make your own

Both have their advantages and disadvantages which I will go through now.
> TLDR: If you want the cheapest in the short term and are only looking to grow a small amount or for a short time, go with option 1 of premade grain.  If you want the cheapest in the long run, and want to grow a lot of mushrooms or for longer than once or twice, go the 2nd route and make your own.

## Premade Grain
Let me start off by saying premade grain is awesome for beginners!  If you aren't sure you are going to enjoy this hobby, or just want to grow a limited amount or for a limited time it may not be worth it for you to invest in a setup for making your own grain.  That's totally fine :)  But, you should be aware of both the pros & cons before committing.

| Pros ‚úÖ      | Cons ‚ùå |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Lower up front cost | Higher risk of contamination |
| No Pressure Cooker Required | Higher cost in the long run |

### Premade Grain Options
You have 2 main options when choosing premade grain.
1. Uncle Bens rice (Microwaveable Rice)
This is by far the cheapest and most common option.  There is even a whole community around this method!  Here are some great resources:

2. Premade grain bags
You can find premade grain bags ready for mushroom cultivation.  These have already been prepped and sterilized for you and are ready to go.  Common examples of grain bags include popcorn, oats, rye, and milo.  I will give a shotout to my local grow shop ColoradoCultures and their 3lb popcorn grain bags [here](https://www.coloradoculturesllc.com/product-page/3lb-organic-sterilized-human-grade-popcorn-grain-spawn).

## Homemade Grain üåü
Making your own grain may seem intimidating at first, but it is very straightforward and I find the process to be very enjoyable and therepudic.

You will need the following supplies.  While it may seem like a lot at first, these tools will be vital for many things in mycology and will last you a long time

### Supplies
1. Pressure Cooker:
This will be used for sterilzing and potentially hydrating your grain.  This tool can also come in handy down the line for things like Agar and Liquid Culture.
I reccommend a 16 or 24qt Presto pressure cooker.  The larger of the two may be helpful in the future, but a 16qt is plenty big for starting out.

2. Mason Jars or Unicorn Bags

## Whats Next?

Now that you have your grain ready, we can move onto innoculation!
